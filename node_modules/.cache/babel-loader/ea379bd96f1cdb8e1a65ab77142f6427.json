A childhood of  hockey and camping led to an\n                            outdoorsy team player. Inevitably, Jeff chose to join the  military shortly after enjoying all his small-town high school's science. He spent four\n                            years  working as an Armored Crewman before eventually stumbling upon his passion for  medicine. As soon as he was able, he committed to being a \n                            Medical Technician. Out of the many years that Jeff spent as a Medical Technician in the Canadian Forces, he  gained a keen interest in helping the\n                            sick and injured military members. This led naturally  to the motivation to put his military career on pause to seek out further education and  \n                            training so that he may put that effort to greater use. In his last year of Software and  Biomedical Engineering at the University of Calgary, \n                            he studied, practiced, and created many  ideas in the vein of medical engineering. Jeff's main interests involve using machine learning and artificial\n                            intelligence to collect and  analyze various medical data platforms. During his last year, he embarked on a capstone  project involving tissue perfusion \n                            data and its use for detecting systemic shock. Additionally,  he has endeavored in an undergraduate thesis, which improves the robustness of machine  \n                            learning models involving CT (Computerized Tomography) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance  Imaging) images. With intellectual abilities in data handling, \n                            clustering, model architecture, preprocessing,  and clinical application knowledge, Jeff hopes to work towards a job in medical image  processing \n                            or machine learning applications in medical programs. \n                        </p>*/}\n                        </div>\n                        \n                        <div className = \"Profile\">\n                            <img src = {Youssef} className = \"profile-pic\"></img>\n                            <h1 className = \"name\">Youssef Maksoud - Full Stack Developer</h1>\n                            {/*<p className = \"biography\">Youssef was born in Cairo, Egypt where he lived for two years before moving to Calgary in  2002. His career as a competitive\n                            swimmer started at 4 years old. Throughout school, and  first year of university, Youssef continued his career and retired at the age of 18 after having\n                            qualified, participated and placed at national level competitions. Youssef was also a world  trials qualifier in 2018. After the end of his career, \n                            Youssef chose to pursue software/  biomedical engineering at the U of C, while bodybuilding competitively. Youssef focuses on software engineering and its\n                            endless bank of knowledge and expertise.  Throughout university, Youssef has had experience designing, coding, and testing software  systems as well as database\n                            management systems. In the future, he aims to be employed as  a full stack developer (focuses on implementation of software systems). In this last year, Youssef\n                            has begun work on his capstone project (graduation project) where  he focuses on designing, implementing, and testing a software-based system that receives,  \n                            processes, and visualizes incoming tissue perfusion (oxidation levels) data from a remote  incoming trauma patient. During the same summer, Youssef worked as a \n                            freelance software  engineer where he enjoyed aiding other students in understanding and writing code. In his  own time, he will be learning the necessary technical \n                            skills to implement the capstone, as  well as gaining applicable skills for the software industry. \n                            </p>*/}\n                        </div>\n                        \n                        <div className = \"Profile\">\n                            <h1 className = \"name\">Randy Moore - Sensor hardware Lead</h1>\n                            <img src = {Randy} className = \"profile-pic\"></img>\n                            {/*<p className = \"biography\">Randy is from Chestermere, Alberta.

Through his involvement in the Brain Bee Competition and First Robotics in high  school, \n                            Khaled has developed a keen interest in Robotics in the medical field. Throughout his university experience, Khaled incorporated his own national company\n                            in  2016, known as Tutoring Education Centre, of which he was able to assist more than 200  students to reach their academic potential. Some of these \n                            students went forward to become  Engineering students and medical students at the University of Calgary, the University of  Alberta, the University of Waterloo,\n                            the University of Toronto, and the University of British  Columbia. He also incorporated his own Canadian non-profit organization in 2021 by the \n                            name of Egyptian Youth Club that aims to bring Egyptians together through social activities  and community service. Furthermore, Khaled has successfully \n                            run in 2 Students’ Union  elections of which he has been elected as the Schulich School of Engineering Representative. In the technical field, Khaled has been \n                            involved in 5 different research positions as well as  various industrial projects throughout the past 3 years of his undergraduate degree. He  initiated RISE for \n                            Health and Wellness, a Cumming School of Medicine initiative dedicated to  making high school immigrant youth leaders in health, and developed the laboratory  material \n                            for the Instrumentation, Sensors and Interfacing (ENEL 301) course at the Schulich  School of Engineering. Khaled also developed an add-on software for\n                            AutoCAD for Graham  Construction, and he is the external tester for Arduino products of which he recently  completed the analysis of the Arduino \n                            Engineering Kit Rev. 2.
